# terraform_aws_vpc_peer

This is a Terraform module to create a VPC peering between two VPCs. By
default, this module will set up the peer between VPCs within the same
account. However, by supplying the `peer_account_id`, `peer_role_arn`, and
`requester_role_arn` options, this this module can create and accept peers
across two different accounts, so long as the credentials that call TF can
assume the roles of both the supplied owner and peer roles, and those
respective roles have access to perform the peering.

Routes are controlled via supplying the subnet quantities, subnet IDs, route
table quantities, and route table IDs to the appropriate `*_subnet_count`,
`*_subnet_ids`, `*_route_table_count`, and `*_route_table_ids` parameters
for both the peer and owners. Via these variables, it's possible to
selectively peer only the subnets that you need.

## Example with single account


    // vpc1 provides the first (owner) VPC.
    module "vpc1" {
      source                  = "github.com/paybyphone/terraform_aws_vpc?ref=v0.1.0"
      project_path            = "${var.project_path}"
      public_subnet_addresses = ["${var.owner_subnet_address}"]
      vpc_network_address     = "${var.owner_vpc_address}"
    }

    // vpc2 provides the second (peer VPC).
    module "vpc2" {
      source                  = "github.com/paybyphone/terraform_aws_vpc?ref=v0.1.0"
      project_path            = "${var.project_path}"
      public_subnet_addresses = ["${var.peer_subnet_address}"]
      vpc_network_address     = "${var.peer_vpc_address}"
    }

    // vpc_peer provides the VPC peer between our two VPCs.
    module "vpc_peer" {
      source                  = "github.com/paybyphone/terraform_aws_vpc_peer?ref=VERSION"
      owner_route_table_count = 1
      owner_route_table_ids   = ["${module.vpc1.public_route_table_id}"]
      owner_subnet_count      = "${length(var.owner_subnet_address)}"
      owner_subnet_ids        = "${module.vpc1.public_subnet_ids}"
      owner_vpc_id            = "${module.vpc1.vpc_id}"
      peer_route_table_count  = 1
      peer_route_table_ids    = ["${module.vpc2.public_route_table_id}"]
      peer_subnet_count       = "${length(var.peer_subnet_address)}"
      peer_subnet_ids         = "${module.vpc2.public_subnet_ids}"
      peer_vpc_id             = "${module.vpc2.vpc_id}"
      project_path            = "${var.project_path}"
    }

## Example with multiple accounts

A multi-account example is a little more complex and tough to include in a
README. See the [example/multi-account](example/multi-account) directory for
a full example. Note that this example also makes use of
[aws-runas](https://github.com/vancluever/aws-runas), so you may need to
adjust the example to fit your specific toolchain.

## Removing the Peer from Configuration

Special considerations need to be taken when removing this resource from a
Terraform configuration due to some current known issues with how Terraform
handles provider aliases embedded in modules. For more details and
instructions on how to remove this module from config, see
[here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1819#issuecomment-261316458).
Note that this only applies to configurations that are being fully destroyed.
`terraform destroy` will work as expected.



## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| allow_owner_peer_dns_resolution | Allows clients in the owner VPC to resolve DNS hostnames as if they those queries were being made in the peer VPC (ie: RDS instance hostnames will resolve as local addresses). This option is generally only useful for AWS-managed DNS resources only. | string | `false` | no |
| allow_peer_owner_dns_resolution | Allows clients in the peer VPC to resolve DNS hostnames as if they those queries were being made in the owner VPC (ie: RDS instance hostnames will resolve as local addresses). This option is generally only useful for AWS-managed DNS resources only. | string | `false` | no |
| owner_route_table_count | The number of owner route tables to expect.<br><br>This value cannot be computed by the time the module is processed or else you will get an error. | string | - | yes |

| owner_vpc_id | The VPC ID of the VPC that owns the peer. | string | - | yes |
| peer_account_id | The account ID of the peer VPC. If this is supplied, `peer_role_arn` and `requester_role_arn` should be supplied as well to ensure correct connectivity to both VPCs to automatically request and accept the peer. | string | `` | no |
